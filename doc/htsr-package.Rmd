# Origin
## Brief history
IRD and previously ORSTOM have developed quite early (in the 70ties) data bases for storing hydrological and meteorological time-series. During the 80ties the managing tools use home-made
codes (Hydrom and Pluviom), which were later adapted to commercial applications like Microsoft Access or Oracle.

With the development of open access platforms and applications in the one hand, and the need of 
more flexibility, it appears useful to build an set of functions able to manage hydro-meteo time-series independently of the operating system and of proprietary 
tools.

The package was developed on the basis of the public domain data base management system Sqlite and 
on the hydro-meteo time-series data base application Hydraccess. 
 
It works on Linux, Windows or MacOS platforms, with the free programming language R (<https://www.r-project.org/>) and the interface RStudio (<https://rstudio.com/>) preliminary 
installed.

## Hydraccess
Hydraccess was developed at IRD (<http://www.ird.fr>) by Philippe Vauchel. It is based on several tools provided by Microsoft Office (R) including Microsoft Access. It can be obtained from <https://hybam.obs-mip.fr/fr/hydraccess-2/>

Hydracces is available in French, English, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian.

## Sqlite data base
Sqlite is an embedded data base on the public domain (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite>).
It is self-contained, and serverless, without preliminary configuration. It can be installed using the instructions given by <https://sqlite.org/download.html>.

# Principle  

The Sqlite data base is organized with the same tables and fields as the Hydraccess structure, except that the table names are changed for practical reasons. A correspondence of these names in given in appendix.

In Hydraccess, two families or time-series coexist: "hydro data" (Type_Station = H) and "weather data" (Type_Station = M). The first one includes the main tables Cotes/WL, Debits/DI and Qualite/QU; the second one includes Pluies/PR and Meteo/WE. Other tables regarding discharge measurements or calibration are also affected to the "hydro data" family.

This distinction does not exist anymore in the Sqlite data base processes. That means that one should verify if no stations  have the same name in the one and the other family. If it is the case the name must be changed before converting a Hydraccess data base in a Sqlite data base.

A time-series is always attached to a **station**, which describes its location and managing infos, and to a **sensor**, which is attached to the data type and to the used device. Both are indexed with a main id. 

In Hydraccess:

* **The station id** has no particular syntax; it associated to a number of description fields. Note that the station Name field is mandatory.

* **The capteur/sensor id** has at most 5 digits and the first one defines the timestep of the variable: **I** for instantaneous, **J** for daily and **M** for monthly. By convention, a daily value is affected at 12:00:00 and a monthly value to the day 16 at 00:00:00. This convention remains for the Sqlite data base. The other 4 digits of the sensor id are free in Hydraccess. In the Sqlite data base the sensor id length is not any more limited, but it could be a good idea to conserve it. Other description fields are also associated with the sensors.

In brief, that means that a time-series record must have 4 objects:

* a date-time;

* a numeric value;

* a station id factor;

* a sensor id factor.

Practically it associates the two tables "station" and "sensor" with one of the five following: "water level", "discharge", "weather", "precipitation" or "quality".

The other associated tables can be used for intermediary calculations, like the computation of the discharge from the water level, or for more detailed information.


# Dependencies

The following packages and their own dependencies are needed to apply the htsr package.

* `tidyverse`, `DBI`, `directlabels`, `editData`, `openair`, `RSQLite`, `RODBC`, `shiny`, `WriteXLS`, `zoo`

## Special case of RODBC

Because Hydraccess is only configured for Microsoft Windows, the associated data bases work only on this platform. That means that the operation, which consists to convert a Hydraccess data base into a Sqlite data base must be done in this environment. The `RODBC` package is associated to the htsr package, but it can be only used in the Windows platform through the function `d_convert_hydraccess`. In particular, **this function does not work on Linux**.
 
Because a Hydracces data base is proprietary dependant, a preliminary configuration of the MS-Windows platform must be done:

* Install "Microsoft Database Engine" (<http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13255>)

* In the administration tools, config the connection ODBC 32b with the Access data base to be used. An alternative consists to execute `\windows\sysWOW64\odbcad32.exe`.

* Open the RStudio session in 32b (this can be precised in the RStudio general options ; RStudio must be re-launched for taking the change into account).
